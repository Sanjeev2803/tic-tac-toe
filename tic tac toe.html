            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Play Tic-tac-toe Professionally</h2>
            <h3>Equipment:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>A 3x3 grid, either drawn on paper or a game board.</li>
              <li>Two players, usually designated as Player 1 and Player 2.</li>
              <li>Two different symbols, typically X and O, to represent the players.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Determining the Starting Player:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The starting player can be determined by mutual agreement, a random method, or any other fair means.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Taking Turns:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Players alternate turns, starting with the first player.</li>
              <li>Each player places their symbol (X or O) on any empty square in the grid.</li>
              <li>Once a symbol is placed, it cannot be moved or changed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Winning Conditions:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:</li>
              <li>a. One player successfully places three of their symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
              <li>b. All nine squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, resulting in a draw.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Game End:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If a winning condition is met, the player who achieved it is declared the winner.</li>
              <li>If all squares are filled and no winning condition is met, the game ends in a draw.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Replay:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>After the game ends, players can decide to play again by following the steps mentioned above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While Tic-tac-toe is a relatively simple game, professional play involves advanced strategies and tactics to maximize winning chances. Skilled players often employ specific opening moves and defensive maneuvers to counter their opponent's strategies.</p>
            <p>Additionally, variations of Tic-tac-toe exist, such as larger grid sizes (e.g., 4x4) or the addition of additional rules, to increase the complexity and challenge of the game.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that professional Tic-tac-toe competitions and organizations don't typically exist, as the game's simplicity makes it less suitable for professional play compared to other strategic board games.</p>
